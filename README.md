# Network Topology Simulator

Welcome to the **Network Topology Simulator**, a web-based interactive tool designed to help users **visualize, design, and simulate computer networks**.  
It allows you to create routers, switches, and hosts, connect them dynamically, and observe how packets flow through the network in real time.

---

## Overview

The simulator provides an intuitive **drag-and-drop canvas interface** for building and experimenting with network topologies.  
Users can easily visualize how devices interconnect and explore how routing works between nodes.

### Key Highlights
- 🧭 Interactive **topology designer**
- 💻 Devices: **Routers**, **Switches**, and **Hosts**
- 🔗 Dynamic link creation between nodes
- 🚀 **Packet tracing visualization**
- 📊 Real-time **routing table display**
- 🎨 Modern, color-coded, and user-friendly interface

---

## Features

- 🖱️ **Drag & Drop Interface** — Move and connect network nodes seamlessly.  
- 🌐 **Multiple Node Types** — Routers (🔵), Switches (🟢), and Hosts (🟠).  
- 🔗 **Interactive Linking** — Click two nodes to create a network link.  
- 💡 **Dynamic Visualization** — See how packets flow across your topology.  
- 📊 **Routing Table View** — Display routing and connection information.  
- 🎨 **Visually Appealing UI** — Smooth animations, vibrant colors, and responsive design.

## Technologies Used

- ⚛️ **React (Vite)** — Fast and modern frontend framework  
- 🖌️ **Konva.js** — For interactive canvas rendering  
- 🧠 **Node.js + Express.js** — Backend logic and API layer  
- 🌐 **Axios** — Frontend–backend communication  
- 🆔 **UUID** — Unique identification for network nodes and links  

---

## How It Works

1. Add devices (Routers, Switches, Hosts) to the network canvas.  
2. Click one node and then another to connect them.  
3. Drag and reposition devices — links update automatically.  
4. Use the routing table to understand node connections.  
5. Watch packet flow animations to visualize data transfer.

## Future Enhancements

- ⚙️ Real-time multi-user collaboration  
- 💾 Save and load topologies from the backend  
- 🕹️ Advanced packet animation and route tracing  
- 🔐 Authentication and secure API endpoints  
- 🧩 Integration with real network simulation tools (future scope)
